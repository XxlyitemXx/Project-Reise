New Features:

Rename Group Chats:

/gc rename [gc-name] [new-gc-name] or ?gc rename [gc-name] [new-gc-name]: Change the name of a group chat. Only the owner or admins can do this.
Group Chat Admins:

/gc admin [gc-name] [member] or ?gc admin [gc-name] [member]: Grant admin permissions to a member in a group chat. Admins can add/remove members but not delete the group chat.
Join Announcements:

When someone is added to a group chat, Riese will announce it in the channel, mentioning the user who added them.
Leave Command:

/gc leave [gc-name] or ?gc leave: Leave a group chat you're a member of. Owners should use /gc delete or ?gc delete instead.
The ?gc leave command can be used without specifying the gc-name if you're already in the group chat channel.
